# Time
It flows in thick green strands all around me, unidirectionally down. I feel the gloopy, heavy ropes of time constricting me when I step forwards, so I focus, shake them off and slip past them.

I see the girl, her head reaching no higher than my waist. I approach her and crouch so my head is only barely higher than hers. She's looking the other way, but knowing her, not for long.

She jumps when she sees me, almost toppling me off balance. I instinctively put a hand on the ground behind me, and push myself back up to a crouch. She walks back to me, a sense of curiosity emanating from her.

"Hello there." I whisper softly as she leans in, eyes wide.

"Hi!" she squeaks out.

"Take this." I smile, hiding my sharp canines. In my outstretched palm is a little monkey's fist of glowing green thread. "I'm your friend."

"Thank you." The girl takes the thread and watches it dissolve in her hand, the glowing green time making soft arcs up her arm until it reaches her face. She stands frozen as the time goes into her eyes, and when she blinks again, I see another half-hour added on her clock.

It's an addiction. When she grows up she'll want me to trade for days, weeks, years, and then she'll reach her old age where she'll have nothing left to barter. Then she'll scrounge and beg for days, hours, minutes, and then with nothing left, I'll watch her thread fall through the ground like she was never here.
